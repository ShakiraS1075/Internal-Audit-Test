# Internal-Audit-Test

This project involved conducting an internal security audit for a fictional generic business. The assessment utilized a risk assessment documentation report to identify potential vulnerabilities within the business. The risk assessment document begins with an outline of the scope, company goals, and an inventory of the business’s current assets to highlight the components of its infrastructure. The test is then evaluated using a controls/compliance checklist to identify potential exploits or vulnerabilities. This process helps verify whether the business is compliant with relevant regulations and legal government standards. In conclusion, I provided recommendations for enhancing the business’s security measures to mitigate potential risks. I outlined the key weaknesses the business faces and proposed the most effective solutions to strengthen its security infrastructure.
